# BLACK-BAR — Project Config

## Problem
Forensic expert reports take too long to produce manually. BlackBar accelerates Lane Swainston's (father, forensic expert) report output using an AI-assisted pipeline that moves cases through 4 sequential stages — Intake → Research → Drafting → QA — with a single human checkpoint at the end before delivery.

## Architecture
Multi-agent pipeline webapp. Each stage has a dedicated AI agent spec. The webapp provides the UI for case management, document handling, and agent activity monitoring. Lane reviews the final QA output (one human checkpoint) before the report ships.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript 5.9 + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS 4
- Backend: Express 5 + TypeScript (tsx runtime)
- ORM: Prisma 6.19 (PostgreSQL on Railway)
- State: Zustand 5 + TanStack React Query 5
- Auth: bcrypt + JWT
- AI: Anthropic SDK 0.82
- Deploy: Railway (railway.toml at project root)
- All webapp code lives in `webapp/`

## Commands (run from webapp/)
| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite + Express concurrently |
| `npm run build` | TypeScript compile + Vite build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (flat config) |
| `npm run db:generate` | Prisma generate client |
| `npm run db:push` | Push schema to Railway PostgreSQL |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed database |

## Directory Navigation
- `webapp/src/pages/` — Dashboard, CaseIntake, CaseResearch, CaseDrafting, CaseQA, CaseExport, Login
- `webapp/src/components/shared/` — AgentActivityFeed, BearMark, HumanCheckpoint, SkeletonLoader, StageNav, EmptyState
- `webapp/server/routes/` — API: auth, cases, documents, reports, agents
- `webapp/server/services/` — Business logic
- `webapp/prisma/schema.prisma` — DB schema
- `agents/` — Pipeline specs (Intake → Research → Drafting → QA)
- `Brand/` — Logo, "Forensic Noir" design philosophy
- `Cases/` — Privileged (never commit without explicit request)
- `reports/` — QA output from `.claude/skills/qa-pipeline/`

## Agent Pipeline
Sequential: Intake → Research → Drafting → QA
- Specs: `agents/{stage}/BlackBar-{Stage}.md`
- Voice: `VOICE.md` | Domain: `ENTERPRISE_BRAIN.md`
- QA skill: `.claude/skills/qa-pipeline/SKILL.md`

## Quick Reference
- `STATE.md` — **Current webapp state + 5-PR build sequence (read first on any UI task)**
- `QUICKFIND.md` — "I need X → go to Y" lookup
- `DIRECTORY_MAP.md` — Full file inventory
- `ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_v1.1.md` — Current arch assessment
- `BLACKBAR_UI_SPEC_v3.md` — Legacy UI spec (superseded by v2 design system below)

## Design System v2 — Forensic Noir × Dannaway Craft
Active 2026-04-16. Drives all new UI work.
- `Brand/DESIGN_TOKENS_v1.md` — canonical token spec
- `Brand/UI_REFERENCE_v1.html` — living reference (open in browser)
- `webapp/src/styles/tokens.css` — implemented CSS (additive layer, non-breaking)
- `webapp/src/styles/MIGRATION.md` — v1 → v2 token map
- `.claude/PERSONA_CHERNY_DANNAWAY.md` — system prompt that drives decisions

Core design rules: no glassmorphism as identity · no gradients · Inter Tight (not Inter) + Fraunces · no pure black/white · 8px rhythm · every surface has empty/loading/error states · `prefers-reduced-motion` honored · `[AGENT BLIND]` pill on any feature lacking agent reasoning. Migrate one component per PR.

## Environment
- .env at project ROOT (not webapp/) — DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, PORT
- Railway reads railway.toml for build/deploy
- Express on port 3001, Vite proxies /api

## Do NOT
- Use `grep -P` in scripts — macOS BSD grep, use `grep -E`
- Assume Prisma version — it is 6.19, check package.json
- cd into BLACK-BAR when user said Bloom Soft (or vice versa)
- Create files in Cases/ or benchmarks/ without explicit request

## HARD RULES — DO NOT VIOLATE

- **NEVER** use `tsx` in any `start` script or any production build command. Production runs compiled JS only: `node dist/server/index.js`.
- **NEVER** change `webapp/package.json` `"start"` script to anything other than `node dist/server/index.js`.
- **NEVER** add `tsx` as a production dependency. It belongs in `devDependencies` only and is permitted only in `dev`/`dev:server`/`db:seed` style scripts that exist for local development.
- **Railway runs the `package.json` `start` script.** It must always be `node dist/server/index.js`. The `build` script is responsible for emitting the server JS to `dist/server/`. If you change one, audit the other.
- Prowl is dormant. Do not wire prowl.ts, sentinel.ts, or pipelineMetrics.ts into production routes until runAgent returns AgentResult and acceptance-rate data exists from 20+ real cases.
HEAD

## Deploy Workflow
- All development work pushes to `staging` branch first
- Verify on staging URL before merging to main
- Only `main` deploys to production (Lane's URL)
- Command: git push origin staging → test → git checkout main && git merge staging → git push origin main
- NEVER push untested code directly to main

- NEVER modify schema.prisma without creating a Prisma migration. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name <description>` for every schema change.
